Hello, my name is Jim. I'm a dad, husband, software developer, lover of open source, speaker, and in my free time I like to draw, ski and hike.

I'm the author of Commitizen, a tool that helps make it easier to have consistent commit messages so that you can leverage tools like semantic release to generate changelogs and github releases from your commit messages.

I try to write as much as possible but when I get busy, it sometimes takes a back seat to other things.

If you have questions or want to reach me, please feel free to ping me on Twitter.

Thanks!
