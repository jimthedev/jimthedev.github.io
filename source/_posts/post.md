The following is a presentation that I gave at several conferences and it covers some of the basic concepts in Angular 2 and TypeScript. At the time of this recording Angular 2 was still in alpha so some of the code may be outdated. Nevertheless, the concepts should continue to be useful as you learn about Angular 2 or any component based framework that encourages uni directional data flow.

Check out the [slides](http://slides.com/jimthedev/getting-started-with-angular-2-and-typescript#/) and follow along.

I've also included a [recorded version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KL4Yi3WtymA) of the talk.

I hope it is helpful as you learn about Angular 2!
